/**
 A code block manager that execeures blocks that may throw Objective-C
 execptions not normally visible to the Swift module. For example,
 the NSKeyUnarchiver.unarchiveObjectWithFile(_:String) Swift method will
 throw an NSException if the file is not a valid archive, causing the
 application to crash. This allows for elegant exception handling.
 @note: Exceptions should be handled on a specific basis, and the default
 catch block should only be used during the debugging deployment phase.
